A collection of simulations related to the laser-cooling of antihydrogen for the ALPHA experiment.

# Simulations
- `optmol` contains semiclassical Monte Carlo simulations for the standard "optical molasses" laser cooling.

# Other directories
- `lib` contains reusable utility code for the different simulations.
- `plotting` contains simple Python scripts for quick and dirty plotting
- `vendor/pcg-cpp-0.98` contains the PCG RNG, which provides faster random number generation than the C++ <random> library.
